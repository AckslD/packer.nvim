# packer.nvim
An experimental Neovim plugin manager in Lua for speed and ease of development, with some neat
lazy-loading features.

## Status
**tl;dr**: Late alpha. You can probably use it and it'll probably work, but it's not done and not
super stable yet.

- Basic package management seems to work (i.e. installation, updating, cleaning, start/opt plugins,
  displaying results)
- More testing is needed
- The code is rather messy and needs cleanup and refactoring

## Current work
- Compiling lazy-loading code

## TODO
- Luarocks support
- Allow multiple packages
- Optimizations?
